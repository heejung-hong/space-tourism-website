## My process


### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS

### What I learned

This is my first time working with Sass and I'm glad I did with this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [YouTube SCSS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - This video tutorial showed me the basics of implementing Sass in an actual project. 

- [Sass Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - This is the official Sass website where the guide shows SCSS examples alongside the compiled CSS.
